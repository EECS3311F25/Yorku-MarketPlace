## 1. Sprint 1 Demo Summary

We have successfully completed our **Sprint 1 demo**, which was recorded on Zoom (approximately 6 minutes long). All team members were present during the session. The focus for this sprint was implementing the **core features** outlined during our planning meeting.

### Features Demonstrated

- **Signup Page with YorkU Email Validation:**  
  Implemented a signup page that strictly validates email addresses. Only emails ending in `@my.yorku.ca` or `@yorku.ca` are accepted. Users attempting to sign up with non-YorkU emails (e.g., Gmail) receive a clear error message.

- **"Forgot Password" Flow:**  
  Added a fully functional “Forgot Password” button and corresponding page. Users can enter their email to initiate a password reset request.

- **Live Backend Integration:**  
  Demonstrated a live backend running on the **Spring Framework (Spring Boot)** and managed using **Maven**. The demo included a walkthrough of our class structure and project organization. **Spring Security** has been integrated to handle user authentication.

## 2. Sprint 1 Retrospective

Following the demo, our team conducted a retrospective to reflect on the sprint’s performance and collaboration.

### What Went Well
- Excellent task distribution — everyone clearly understood their responsibilities.  
- Effective time management despite midterm exams.  
- Strong communication and teamwork throughout the sprint.

### What We’re Doing Differently
- Increased frequency of **in-person meetings** rather than relying solely on online chats.  
- Real-time collaboration improved bug fixing and alignment among team members.

### Practices to Re-evaluate
- No significant issues were identified during Sprint 1.  
- We plan to continue monitoring and refining our workflow as project complexity grows.

### Best Part of the Sprint
- Team coordination and balanced workload distribution led to a smooth and productive sprint.  
- Each member contributed meaningfully without excessive last-minute pressure.

### Worst Part of the Sprint
- No major negative experiences to report — Sprint 1 was overall positive and successful.

## 3. Notes for the TA

- The **Zoom demo video** includes all team members and demonstrates all implemented features in real-time.  
- All **setup and installation instructions** are clearly documented in the project’s `README.md` file on GitHub.  
- The demo features **live application usage** interacting with the backend — not static screenshots.  

We appreciate your time in reviewing our Sprint 1 submission and look forward to your feedback.

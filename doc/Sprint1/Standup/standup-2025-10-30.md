\[2025-10-30] – Sprint 1 Standup 2



1.What did you work on since the last standup?

Implemented the login system and created maven-publish.yml for automated build publishing.

Encountered an issue where the site keeps redirecting to the login page when trying to create a listing.



2.What do you commit to next?

Remake the HTML and CSS layout from scratch and temporarily remove non-functional buttons.

Focus entirely on setting up an SMTP email forwarding service to verify users and restrict sign-ups to @yorku.ca addresses.



3.When do you think you'll be done?

SMTP verification setup expected by Nov 1.



4.Do you have any blockers?

Current blocker: redirect loop in login-listing flow caused by session validation. Rebuilding UI to resolve.

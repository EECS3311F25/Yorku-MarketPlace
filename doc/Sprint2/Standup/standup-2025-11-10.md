# 2025-11-10 — Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1\. What did you work on since the last standup?

* Hosted the image service on a local server.
* Set it up so it syncs and creates proper listings including:

  * username
  * price
  * description
  * image

## 2\. What do you commit to next?

* Implement the edit and delete functionality for postings so users can modify or remove their own listings.

## 3\. When do you think you'll be done?

* Targeting completion and stable implementation by **Nov 10**.

## 4\. Do you have any blockers?

No blockers so far — just ensuring users can create listings without any errors.

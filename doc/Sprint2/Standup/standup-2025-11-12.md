# 2025-11-12 — Sprint 2 Standup 2

## 1\. What did you work on since the last standup?

* Implemented edit and delete functionality so users can edit and delete their posts.

## 2\. What do you commit to next?

* improve the code so only the listing owner can edit the posts.

## 3\. When do you think you'll be done?

* Targeting completion and stable implementation by **Nov 14**.

## 4\. Do you have any blockers?

There are minor blockers for this part as the code sometimes doesn't edit properly and gives 404 error and sometimes gives access to edit and delete others users instead of just the post creator.

**Trust signals that matter to students**  
- York tenure, shared courses, residence affiliation, and club roles (opt-in), plus conduct policies aligned to student code.

- Promote reuse of textbooks, furniture, and electronics to reduce waste and student costs.

## Where We’re Better

**First-years moving into residence**  
- Verified sellers, residence-safe item filters, and staffed building meet-ups reduce risk and friction versus broad public platforms.

**Textbook buyers and sellers**  
- Filter by course code, instructor, and edition; prompts reduce mismatches common in generic “Books” categories. In app chat coordinates safe on campus exchanges.

**Campus clubs and organizers**  
- Circulate AV gear, banners, and tickets inside a verified community; recurring events can keep gear in circulation without leaving campus.

**Faculty and staff giveaways**  
- Post surplus office items for student pickup using reservation holds and meet-up points.

**Near-campus housing**  
- Focused inventory for York commuters with walking-time tags, transit hints, and campus safety guidance.

## Why Competitors Haven’t Focused Here

**Scale versus specificity**  
- Large platforms (Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, Craigslist) optimize for national or global liquidity and minimal onboarding friction; deep integration with one university’s identity system and policies is outside their general model.

**Verification friction**  
- Enforcing school email Verification adds integration overhead and support costs. Community-vetted models (e.g., VarageSale) stops short of institutional SSO.

**Academic metadata gap**  
- Course codes, term cycles, and residence rules aren’t native to general marketplaces; adding them would require schema changes and new review policies.

**Campus safety posture**  
- Big platforms offer general safety tips rather than campus-specific meet-up flows or escalation paths aligned to student conduct policies.

## What It Would Take For Them To Compete

- **Identity-gated campus communities** with school email or SSO verification and unique discovery rules per campus.  
- **Academic taxonomy** with course codes, edition fields, and semester-aware prompts for rush periods.  
- **Policy and safety alignment** with moderation tuned to university conduct policies and clear escalation channels.

General marketplaces maximize reach and convenience, but they don’t deliver the identity guarantees, academic metadata, and campus-specific logistics York students care about. By gating membership to yorku.ca, modeling course and term context, providing private in app messaging YorkU Marketplace solves real student pain points that competitors leave unaddressed today.

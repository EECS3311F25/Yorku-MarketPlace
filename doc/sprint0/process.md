# York Marketplace — Process Reflection

## 1. Team Organization
Our team consists of five members, and we make sure that responsibilities are shared equally among everyone. Each person contributes to both the technical and planning sides of the project. While we have defined roles for coordination, everyone participates in discussions, design decisions, and testing.

To stay organized, we assign general focus areas based on interest:

- **Project Coordination:** Scheduling meetings and ensuring deadlines are met.  
- **Frontend Development:** Building the user interface and maintaining design consistency.  
- **Backend Development:** Managing server logic, authentication, and database connections.  
- **UI/UX Design:** Creating mockups, wireframes, and ensuring usability.  
- **Testing & Documentation:** Reviewing features, maintaining sprint deliverables, and writing documentation.  

We rotate tasks when possible so everyone gains experience in multiple areas, keeping the workload fair and balanced.

## 2. Tools and Communication
We rely on several tools to help us collaborate efficiently and track our progress:

- **GitHub Projects** – Used for version control and managing user stories.  
- **Trello** – Helps visualize progress using a “To Do / In Progress / Done” workflow.  
- **Discord** – Used for quick updates, discussions, and daily communication.  
- **Google Meet** – Used for weekly team meetings and sprint planning.  
- **Figma** – For UI/UX mockups and collaborative design editing.  
- **Google Docs** – For drafting documents like `done.md`, `team.md`, and `process.md`.  

We keep communication open at all times. Team members post small updates on Discord whenever they finish or start a task. This way, everyone stays aware of what’s happening, and no one feels left out of the process.

## 3. Decision-Making Process
Our team makes decisions collaboratively. We discuss all important technical, design, and planning choices together so that everyone’s opinion is heard and considered.

If disagreements arise, we take a quick vote and move forward with the majority decision. However, most of the time we are able to reach a consensus after discussion.

- For **design and layout choices**, we usually brainstorm in Figma, where multiple versions are created and the team decides together on what fits the user experience best.  
- For **technical structure**, such as how to handle backend endpoints or database design, we share ideas on Discord before implementing anything in code.  

We make an effort to ensure that every member has a say in the direction of the project, which has helped maintain strong teamwork and mutual respect.

## 4. Prioritization and Story Point Estimation
During sprint planning, we read each user story as a group and estimate how complex it will be using a **Fibonacci-style scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)**.

Each person shares their estimate, and we discuss the reasoning behind our choices.  
When opinions differ, we take one more round of voting after clarifying the complexity or scope. Usually, it takes two rounds of voting to reach an agreement.

We prioritize stories that are essential to the platform’s foundation, such as **account registration, login, and email verification**.  
Features that improve user experience, like **dark mode** or **saved items**, are noted for later sprints once core functionalities are stable.

This approach helps us stay organized and realistic about what can be completed in each phase.

## 5. Meeting Frequency and Collaboration
We meet twice a week:

- **Weekly Planning Meeting (1 hour, Google Meet):** Used to plan tasks, assign responsibilities, and check sprint progress.  
- **Mid-Week Check-In (30 minutes, Discord):** Used for quick updates, identifying blockers, and sharing short-term progress.  

Outside of meetings, we communicate daily through Discord messages. Everyone contributes regularly—whether it’s by coding, reviewing, updating Trello cards, or writing documentation.

We emphasize **collaboration over individual work**. If someone finishes a task early, they often volunteer to help another member debug or review code. This has created a strong sense of teamwork and accountability within the group.

## 6. Lessons Learned and Takeaways
Even though the project is still ongoing, we’ve already learned valuable lessons from our collaboration so far:

- **Clear Communication Helps:** Daily updates prevent confusion and make sure tasks don’t overlap.  
- **Shared Responsibility Works Best:** When everyone contributes equally, the team moves faster and feels more engaged.  
- **Early Planning Saves Time:** Setting up structure, roles, and documentation early helps keep things organized.  
- **Peer Review Improves Quality:** Reviewing each other’s code helps us learn and catch issues early.  
- **Consistency Matters:** Using the same tools and workflows across the team reduces friction and confusion.  

We plan to continue using this collaborative approach for the next phases of the project, maintaining open communication, balanced workloads, and strong documentation habits.

## Conclusion
Our team is working collaboratively, communicates effectively, and ensures that everyone contributes equally to the success of the **York Marketplace** project.  
By staying organized, voting on decisions together, and supporting one another’s progress, we are building a strong foundation for future sprints and for delivering a well-structured, user-friendly product.
